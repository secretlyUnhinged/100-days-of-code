# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 9,2025(Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Started the shorter graph series for revision(by takeuforward). Revised basics of graph,bfs,dfs,intuition behind rotten oranges problem. 

**Thoughts:** Have been tinkering around with codeforces round 1037(div 3) problems A,B,C. Solved A on the first attempt with optimal time complexity solution but struggled with B and C.


### Day 2: August 10,2025(Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Solved rotten oranges, number of provinces, number of islands,flood fill.

**Thoughts:** Hopefully will wrap up graphs by end of this week and move on to trees. Tweaked the recursion function i am "supposed" to use and saw how it affected the whole code, then added necessary conditions to make up for the "missing" argument, instead of blindly accepting the function template.


### Day 3: August 11,2025(Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Revised graph cycle detection algorithm using bfs/dfs and bipartite graph using bfs.

**Thoughts:**

### Day 4: August 13,2025(Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: Revised topological sort using dfs/bfs.

### Day 5: August 15,2025(Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: Did a data science case study project based on clustering for a consultancy startup.
**Thoughts:** Dataset was full of unknown values, to the point that imputation or removal was not possible, hence I created a separate class for it so that it won't lead to noisy clusters. Maybe I could have used inference-based Bayesian formula or decision tree to find the most probable value but it was MNAR. Further investigation could be done to find if there is a pattern to the missingness.

### Day 6: August 16,2025(Friday)

**Today's Progress**: worked on the clustering project some more, used cramers v, silhouette core, Daviesâ€“Bouldin Index (DBI) and mca to finally plot the clusters.
**Thoughts:** number of outliers were more but in mca plot, they were compressed as the feature space was 5d but mca is 2d plot. learnt how to find the features that are more important compared to the rest using statistical methods.

### Day 7: August 23,2025(Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Deep copy of a graph,find the minimum area to cover all ones II(3197)
**Thoughts:** used dfs+hashmap to create a deep copy of a graph. while using dfs,infinite recursion is always a possibility.

### Day 8: August 24,2025(Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: finished find min area to cover all ones II, longest subarray of ones after deleting one elt(1493)
**Thoughts:** look at other approaches to min area problem(i did brute force i think?), uses sliding window+2 pointer ,found a dsa pattern flowchart, will see if it is of any help

### Day 9: August 25,2025(Monday)

**Today's Progress**: diagonal traversal lc, looked into albumentations for an open source contribution to off, learnt about medclip architecture
**Thoughts:** d=r+c and odd diag vs even diag, need to find more suitable open source issues in ml

### Day 10: August 26,2025(Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**: search a 2d matrix lc,
**Thoughts:** flattened and performed binary search.
