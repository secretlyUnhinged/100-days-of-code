# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 9,2025(Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Started the shorter graph series for revision(by takeuforward). Revised basics of graph,bfs,dfs,intuition behind rotten oranges problem. 

**Thoughts:** Have been tinkering around with codeforces round 1037(div 3) problems A,B,C. Solved A on the first attempt with optimal time complexity solution but struggled with B and C.


### Day 2: August 10,2025(Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Solved rotten oranges, number of provinces, number of islands,flood fill.

**Thoughts:** Hopefully will wrap up graphs by end of this week and move on to trees. Tweaked the recursion function i am "supposed" to use and saw how it affected the whole code, then added necessary conditions to make up for the "missing" argument, instead of blindly accepting the function template.


### Day 3: August 11,2025(Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Revised graph cycle detection algorithm using bfs/dfs and bipartite graph using bfs.

**Thoughts:**
